# What IS in that drink?

This [Tropo](www.tropo.com) ruby application accepts an SMS with any alcholoic drink or liquor type and it searches through [TheCocktailDB](www.thecocktaildb.com/) for recipes for a drink with that name or liquor present. For example, if you send "sex on the beach" to this application, you will recieve the incredients to make that drink. If you send "amaretto", you will receive all drinks that contain amaretto in it.

There will be many ways to create these drinks so the application will iterate through all of them depending on how you answer the following question:

> Would you like to see the next drink?

If you answer with 'yes', you will see the next drink in line.
Otherwise, you can start preparing your cocktail with perciscion!
